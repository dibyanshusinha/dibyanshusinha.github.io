dscr: The project Involved creation of An Windows Universal App capable of 2 step encryption and decryption of . AES Encryption & Caesar cipher to make it more secure and robust. It is available for both as Windows 8.1 Desktop App and as Windows Phone 8.1 App. As I had developed WP8 apps only for sideloading... making this available in Windows seemed to be the next obvious learning step.
