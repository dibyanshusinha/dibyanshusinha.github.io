dscr: My Custom developed WordPress theme from Scratch for an accounting client. My client Katy, owner of Redwood Design initially needed a wordpress site to be customized according to her client's need but the theme wasnâ€™t flexible enough. So she rehired me to develop a theme for one of her clients in the Accounting Business. She was very happy with my work. The website is created on WordPress CMS with custom theme according to the client's taste. Client was in a hurry and it took less than 10 days to launch the website from Scratch!
