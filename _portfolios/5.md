dscr: Inspired from the famous Uber app I have developed an easyRide App which can be used to provide transportation when need. User can register and get a taxi on demand using the GPS sensor of their cellphone. There are two different views for driver and customer.<br> Try installing it in two devices one as a rider and other as a driver. From the device with rider mode active create a request and from the other device with driver mode accept the request and the workflow will follow... There is a scope for furthur development, as I developed it as a prototype.<br><strong>Disclaimer- Want this app just to test the functionality ? (Don't share it & uninstall it after testing)</strong>
