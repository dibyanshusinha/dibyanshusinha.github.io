title: Gray's Papaya
dscr: This is unrefined version of the site that was for my client DeSantos. He is from NewYork and at the time of writing has acquired the Gray's Papaya Restaurant Chain there.<br>The HotDog from Gray's Papaya has been featured in many tv shows and films. Even <strong>Barack Obama visited this restaurant chain for his campaign in 2008</strong>. Mr. Santos wanted two different views to choose from so I made two versions of the site. One has seriousness and the other is being a fun and interactive website. Although he bought both of them, he hasn't put the site online as he is working on the offline model first. We will soon see the modified version of this page or the other one hopefully as the official website later this year...
