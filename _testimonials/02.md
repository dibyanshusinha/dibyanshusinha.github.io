"Dibyanshu did very good work on this project. He communicated extremely well and frequently, paying attention to what is asked and what is explained, giving prompt status updates on his own, and asking good questions and only when he needed to. He also took initiative to make his own suggestions and offered his professional insight and experience. All deadlines were met promptly, and never held back any aspects of the project. His quote was fair and competitive and he never avoided making further modifications or implementing custom solutions just to save time. Dibyanshu inspired trust from the start and proved trustworthy throughout."
