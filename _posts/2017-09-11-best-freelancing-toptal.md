**Experience in terms of years ?**


"How many years of experience do you have ?" is probably the worst way to judge a candidate.
Yes, I believe in knowledge gained over time, but a developer should be judged more on the quantity of quality projects rather than just years.

Instead of working on the same monotonous work a better developer would be one who takes different kind of projects and implements it in a logical manner and brings life in the project.




This, I learned from my journey as a web and app developer. I remember myself once as a person who hated coding. I never dreamed of being a coder, I used to run away from it even in my dreams until one fine morning- I had an idea...and the desire to make it real was irresistible. Instead of getting help, I choose to implement it from scratch all by myself even though I knew nothing about it. As I kept struggling, while learning it...it became so natural and the thirst of learning itself became my biggest achievement till date. That was the day I learned the joy of creation itself and now I can't distance myself from it !



After working full-time in a product startup company I learned to be a great team-player but something was missing, the payment was nice but traveling to a remote location for coding the same stuff that can be done from home itself with ofcourse less bureaucratic politics, I believe working remotely is far better with ofcourse greater pay(70% more). That's why I chose to be a freelancer.



Now I get enriched experiences from a large pool of projects, ownership of the implementation, at the sametime constructing my own Brand-image. Most of all if we can't use Internet as a boon ourselves than whats the point in being a Software Developer. I chose to create an office in my own cozy room, rather than traveling to somewhere else, now I just have to take care of the coding itself rather than unnecessary traveling or politics.




My current project is in last milestone, and am looking for a new Gig. Recently I heard of <a href="https://www.toptal.com/web" target='_blank'> TopTal</a>, where one can enjoy the delights of being a Freelancer at the sametime get work from top clients and make a difference. What's more an opportunity sweeter and better than this ? On top of that, if you are on <a href="https://www.toptal.com/web" target='_blank'> TopTal</a>, that means you represent a talent pool of top 3% developers around the world. Now that's a Brand to have. I have begun my interview process, and waiting to contribute soon.




Wish me Luck,
