You are on a vacation and suddenly you realize that you forgot to lock the back-door of your house.
What you can do is just take your mobile and instead of texting this to your sneaky neighbor, text it to your
"SMART" home and it will lock itself from inside. WOW, wasn't that great !!

Similarly In a nutshell IoT/Internet of Things is this great technology enabling your device..eg mobile to talk/communicate to your home
or Car(no you don't necessarily need to own Tesla) or anything else to achieve the desired outcome. So basically the scenario is that Your wrist-watch is measuring how well you are sleeping while you are asleep and keeps in sync with your cellphone, which keeps adjusting your AC to maximize your comfort and at the sametime ensuring your safety by monitoring Intruders outside your house and reporting it to the nearest police-station.

You can control the temperature of your home or the brightness of your bulb by a simple message or even better make it smart and fully automate it, you do have a smartphone right ?!
If you have a smartphone you can easily have a smart-home or smart-bulb automatically adjusting the brightness or temperature according to your mood.
It's that easy. Wait ! Did I mention it's cheap !! No you don't have to waste millions of money to get your hands on it or buy those costly promising "future-tech"
gadgets.

Mention: I read somewhere that Tesla won't be selling cars in India(consumer base +1.3 billion population) !
FunFact: Even if Tesla  did, I can't afford it as of now. ( 50 lakhs!!!) Nor does 90% of India.
Motive: Let's convert our existing cars to Smart Cars. Digital India campaign needs to be transformed to Smarter India. Deliver "Smartness" as an enhancement not just a product.


With the smaller and cheaper yet promising devices such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino etc...combined with Internet can turn pretty much any thing to smarter things, and the best part is you can control it remotely even with your smartphones. This Machine to Machine communication can be a bliss, a full fledged computer(Raspberry Pi-Internet enabled)- costs about 35$ each and use low power so low that running it for an year would cost approx just 5$ !! The sensors are cheaper aswell...

<span class="text-underline">For example To control your electricity remotely you need:</span>

**--One Raspberry Pie**

**--One MQQT Server Service...(many free sources Available)**

**--Internet connection to the Raspberry Pi**

**--One Arduino connected to Raspberry Pi.(optional)**

**--A relay module and a cable**

**--Coding Skills ;)**

**--Time: Depends...for a pro dev it should be about 2-3 days**
<br>
Control Options: Smartphone/Sms/Bluetooth/Tweet etc.
Re-imagine as you fit.<br><br><br><br>

[*Post on Implementation part coming soon*]
